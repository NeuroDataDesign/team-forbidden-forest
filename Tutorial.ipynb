    "> A random forest is a model made up of many decision trees. Rather than just simply averaging the prediction of trees (which we could call a “forest”), this model uses two key concepts that gives it the name random:\n",

    "**The Dataset**\n",
    "The random forest model will be trained to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST database. Each greyscale image is 28 x 28, representing the digits 0-9, and consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. To reduce computational time, this tutorial uses only a subset of the full dataset (10,000 train images and 1,000 test images). Assuming a Gaussian distribution for the MNIST dataset, the dataset is also standardized such that each feature has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n",
